    <h2>Story Summary:</h2>

    <p><i>A woman escapes from a cave under a waterfall with a baby but dies while praying to Lord Shiva to protect the child. A tribal couple rescues and raises the boy as Sivudu. As he grows up, he becomes strong and determined to climb the giant waterfall.

At the top, Sivudu meets Avantika, a rebel warrior trying to free Princess Devasena from the cruel king Bhallaladeva. Sivudu takes on her mission, enters Mahishmati, and rescues Devasena. During the rescue, people recognize him as Baahubali.

The royal commander Kattappa reveals that Sivudu is actually Mahendra Baahubali, the son of the heroic prince Amarendra Baahubali. He explains how Amarendra Baahubali was chosen as the future king but was later betrayed and killed. Shockingly, Kattappa admits that he was forced to kill Baahubali, setting up Sivudu’s destiny to seek justice.</i></p>
